# Images SPA

## Dev Setup
1. `git clone https://github.com/JudgmentJay/takehome.git`
2. `cd takehome`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser

## Filter vs search
1. I opted to go for a filter on the images instead of a search due to the small size of the app. If it were parsing hundreds or thousands of images a search would definitely make more sense, but as it is I think a filter feels a lot snappier.
